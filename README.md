# FinanceTracker (until I come up with a better name)

An Electron application being developed for the Full Stack Open course project at University of Helsinki: https://github.com/fullstack-hy2020/misc/blob/master/harjoitustyo.md Afterwards the plan is to continue development as an open source project since the application replaces my Excel-based workflow of tracking my personal finances.

Tech stack: Typescript / React / Node / SQLite
